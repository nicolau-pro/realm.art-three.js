Realm.Art Coding Challenge - Frontend and 3D

Create a basic React Native/ Web app using Expo, that does the following:

- Render the provided low-poly mesh of a whale inside of a functional React component
- Use React Hooks like getState and getEffect etc. where necessary
- Create a 3D orbit camera that responds to touch/ mouse input (e.g. using OrbitControls: https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls)
- Add a simple animation or transform the mesh using e.g. a vertex shader
- Light it using at least 3 different types of 3D lights (e.g. spotlight, sun/ directional light, ambient lighting/ AO)

You can add other meshes or decorations. The React wrapper around the ThreeJS it can be quite small as the focus on your end might be more 3D than UI if you want.

Please remember not to spend too much time on details, this is just about seeing the way you work and code :) Feel free to get back to me about any questions you might have or if anything is unclear.
